## Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Additions
```typescript
// users/{uid} document
emailFlags: {
  welcomeSentAt?: Timestamp;
  welcomeMessageId?: string;

  epkGuideSentAt?: Timestamp;
  reengagementSentAt?: Timestamp;
  upgrade7DaySentAt?: Timestamp;
  upgrade14DaySentAt?: Timestamp;
  upgradeLimitSentAt?: Timestamp;
}

// Track last activity for re-engagement
lastActiveAt?: Timestamp;
```

### Trigger Logic

2. **Event-based triggers**: Call email API directly when events occur (limit hit, first upload, etc.)

### Postmark Setup Required
- Create email templates in Postmark dashboard (recommended for easier editing)
- Or use `sendTransactionalEmail` with HTML (implemented above)
