Pricing Strategy Definition
Verified Sound – Representation Platform
Pricing Philosophy

Verified Sound pricing reflects structured representation access — not placement guarantees.

The model is designed to:

• Maintain infrastructure sustainability
• Prevent system overload
• Preserve outreach credibility
• Encourage long-term subscription continuity
• Support scalable growth

Pricing must align with operational capacity, not hype-driven positioning.

Value Perception Strategy

Verified Sound is positioned as:

A structured digital representation platform

Not:

• A demo blasting service
• A talent competition
• A pay-for-placement scheme

Pricing communicates professionalism and seriousness.

Low pricing undermines credibility.
Excessive pricing restricts adoption.

Balance is critical.

Revenue Stability Model

Revenue must:

• Cover infrastructure and development
• Maintain healthy operational margins
• Scale predictably with subscriber growth
• Avoid dependency on one-time payments

Recurring subscription revenue is prioritized over transactional fees.

Tier Differentiation Principles

Price differences must reflect:

• Outreach intensity
• Targeting depth
• Reporting sophistication
• Priority queue access

Not vague promises.

Each price tier must map directly to measurable system differences.

Annual Incentive Model

Annual plans may include:

• Discounted monthly rate
• Bonus submission credit
• Extended reporting access

Annual subscriptions increase revenue predictability and reduce churn.

Upgrade Strategy

Upgrades should:

• Be frictionless
• Activate immediately
• Adjust outreach caps dynamically

Downgrades apply at next billing cycle to preserve fairness.

Margin Protection

Pricing must account for:

• Email infrastructure costs
• Hosting and database load
• Opportunity scanning systems
• Development maintenance
• Support overhead

Subscription pricing must not outpace system capacity.

Future Premium Add-Ons (Optional Expansion)

Potential expansion pricing models may include:

• Sync licensing campaigns
• Publisher outreach modules
• Press and blog targeting
• Festival booking targeting
• Advanced analytics reports

These are secondary revenue layers — not core dependency.

Strategic Rule

Pricing will be finalized only after:

• Infrastructure cost modeling
• Email volume capacity testing
• Database growth projections
• Outreach system validation

We price based on sustainability — not speculation.
