Demo Submission Compliance Policy
Verified Sound – Representation Platform

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

Verified Sound LLC is committed to responsible and ethical demo submission practices.

This policy outlines how outreach is governed within the Platform.

1. Respect for Label Policies

Verified Sound submits demos only in accordance with publicly stated label submission guidelines.

We do not:

• Circumvent submission portals
• Send unsolicited attachments where prohibited
• Misrepresent artist identity
• Bypass official demo channels

If a label prohibits unsolicited submissions, that label is excluded from outreach targeting.

2. Compatibility-Based Targeting

Submissions are executed only when compatibility thresholds are met.

Compatibility is determined based on:

• Genre alignment
• Catalog similarity
• Release style
• Artist positioning

This prevents indiscriminate distribution.

3. Volume Control

Verified Sound enforces:

• Monthly submission caps
• Daily outreach limits
• Tier-based volume governance

Mass submission behavior is strictly prohibited.

4. CAN-SPAM Compliance

All outreach communications comply with the United States CAN-SPAM Act.

This includes:

• Clear sender identification
• Accurate subject lines
• No deceptive headers
• Valid business contact information
• Honoring opt-out requests

5. Opt-Out & Removal Requests

If any label or industry contact requests removal from future outreach, that request is honored immediately.

Contacts may be permanently flagged within the system to prevent future submissions.

6. Quality Control Safeguards

Verified Sound may pause or restrict outreach if:

• Artist material fails compatibility standards
• Submission quality concerns arise
• System abuse is detected
• Email infrastructure risk increases

Quality preservation is prioritized over submission volume.

7. No Automation Abuse

The Platform does not engage in:

• Bulk scraping of private email databases
• Unauthorized data harvesting
• Bot-based spamming
• Impersonation of industry entities

Outreach infrastructure is designed to preserve industry credibility.

8. Artist Cooperation Requirement

Artists must:

• Approve generated outreach materials
• Confirm rights ownership
• Ensure material is professionally prepared

Verified Sound reserves the right to refuse submission if standards are not met.

9. Policy Enforcement

Violation of this policy may result in:

• Account suspension
• Outreach restriction
• Permanent termination
