Refund and Cancellation Policy
Verified Sound – Representation Platform

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

This Refund and Cancellation Policy governs subscription payments made to Verified Sound LLC.

1. Subscription Model

Verified Sound operates on a recurring subscription basis.

By subscribing, users agree to automatic renewal at the selected billing interval (monthly or annual) unless cancelled prior to renewal.

2. No Performance-Based Refunds

Verified Sound does not provide refunds based on:

• Lack of label response
• Lack of placement
• Rejection by industry entities
• Career outcome dissatisfaction
• Artistic disagreements

The Platform provides structured representation infrastructure, not guaranteed results.

3. Cancellation Policy

Users may cancel their subscription at any time.

• Monthly plans remain active until the end of the billing cycle.
• Annual plans remain active until the end of the annual term.

Cancellation prevents future billing but does not trigger retroactive refunds.

4. Refund Eligibility

Refunds may be issued only in the following circumstances:

• Duplicate billing errors
• Unauthorized transactions (subject to verification)
• Proven technical failure preventing service delivery

Refund decisions are at the sole discretion of Verified Sound LLC.

5. Chargeback Policy

Initiating a chargeback without first contacting Verified Sound to resolve a dispute may result in:

• Immediate account suspension
• Permanent termination of service
• Restriction from future enrollment

Verified Sound reserves the right to dispute fraudulent chargebacks.

6. Service Suspension for Non-Payment

If payment fails:

• Outreach services pause immediately
• Account access may be restricted
• Subscription remains inactive until payment is resolved

7. Annual Plan Terms

Annual plans are prepaid and discounted.

Early cancellation does not entitle the user to prorated refund unless required by applicable law.

8. Promotional Pricing

Promotional or launch pricing is non-transferable and subject to change.

Verified Sound may honor launch pricing for active subscribers at its discretion.

9. Contact for Billing Issues

Billing questions should be directed to:

Verified Sound will make reasonable efforts to resolve disputes promptly.

10. Policy Updates

This policy may be updated as operational needs evolve.
