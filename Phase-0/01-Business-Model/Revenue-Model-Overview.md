Revenue Model Overview
Verified Sound – Representation Platform
Revenue Philosophy

Verified Sound operates on a subscription-based representation model.

The platform generates recurring revenue by providing structured development, strategic targeting, and controlled outreach services to independent electronic artists seeking professional industry access.

Revenue is not tied to placement guarantees or commission-only structures.

The model prioritizes operational sustainability, scalability, and ethical representation.

Core Revenue Structure

Verified Sound generates revenue through:

• Monthly subscription plans
• Annual subscription plans (discounted)
• Tier-based representation intensity

No commission-based model is used in Phase-1.

No placement guarantee structure is offered.

Tier-Based Representation Model

Each subscription tier determines:

• Outreach volume per cycle
• Targeting depth
• Compatibility scoring intensity
• Campaign reporting access
• Representation frequency
• Support priority

Higher tiers increase strategic intensity — not unrealistic promises.

Recurring Revenue Engine

The platform is designed as a recurring revenue system.

Revenue predictability comes from:

• Subscription continuity
• Automated campaign cycles
• Ongoing opportunity scanning
• Structured reporting cadence

Artists remain enrolled because representation is continuous rather than one-time.

Cost Considerations

Operational costs include:

• Infrastructure hosting
• Database management
• Opportunity scanning systems
• Outreach execution systems
• Email reputation management
• Development and maintenance

The subscription structure must maintain margin after these fixed and variable costs.

Financial Discipline Principles

No unsustainable high-volume submission promises

No guarantee-based refund traps

No overextension beyond infrastructure capacity

Controlled scaling based on system performance

The model scales by increasing subscriber count, not by increasing reckless outreach volume.

Expansion Revenue Potential

Future expansion opportunities may include:

• Genre expansion
• Sync licensing targeting
• Publisher outreach layers
• Premium campaign add-ons
• Industry analytics reports
• Institutional label-side services

These expansion models are secondary to core subscription stability.

Long-Term Revenue Objective

Build a predictable recurring revenue platform capable of scaling artist representation without proportional staff expansion.

Sustainable growth, not hype growth.
