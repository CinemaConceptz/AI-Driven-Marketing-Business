Market Problem Statement
Verified Sound – Representation Platform
Industry Overview

The independent electronic music market has grown significantly due to digital distribution, streaming platforms, and global accessibility. However, while music creation has become more accessible, professional industry access has not evolved at the same pace.

Independent artists face structural barriers when attempting to reach labels, publishers, and A&R representatives.

Core Problems Facing Independent Artists
1. Fragmented Industry Access

There is no centralized, structured pathway for independent artists to access active labels accepting demos. Artists must manually search across websites, social platforms, and outdated directories to identify opportunities.

This process is inconsistent, inefficient, and unreliable.

2. Poor Demo Targeting

Many artists send demos without understanding:

• Label sound identity
• Release cadence
• Artist roster alignment
• Market positioning

As a result, submissions are often ignored due to poor strategic fit rather than lack of talent.

3. Lack of Professional Positioning

Independent artists frequently lack:

• Industry-standard Electronic Press Kits
• Structured artist narratives
• Clear branding alignment
• Professional pitch language

This weakens credibility even when music quality is strong.

4. No Campaign Tracking Infrastructure

DIY submissions offer no tracking system.

Artists cannot see:

• Which labels were contacted
• Open rates
• Response rates
• Follow-up timing
• Campaign performance trends

Without data, there is no optimization.

5. Traditional Representation Is Inaccessible

Conventional artist management and A&R representation:

• Is highly selective
• Requires proven traction
• Is expensive or commission-based
• Has limited capacity

Emerging independent artists are left without structured representation options.

The Market Gap

There is currently no structured, scalable representation platform that:

• Develops professional artist positioning
• Continuously monitors active label opportunities
• Executes targeted demo outreach
• Tracks campaign performance
• Operates on a transparent subscription model

This gap creates inefficiency for artists and missed opportunities for labels seeking new talent.

Verified Sound’s Position in the Market

Verified Sound exists to modernize the representation process by providing structured development, strategic targeting, and disciplined outreach through an automated infrastructure designed specifically for independent electronic artists.

The platform fills the gap between:

DIY chaos
and
Traditional representation exclusivity.
