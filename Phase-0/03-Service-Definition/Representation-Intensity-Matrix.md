Representation Intensity Matrix
Verified Sound – Representation Platform
Purpose

This document defines how subscription tiers translate into operational intensity within the representation infrastructure.

It ensures that outreach, targeting depth, and reporting access are governed by structured system rules rather than manual interpretation.

Intensity Variables

Representation intensity is determined by the following variables:

Submission Volume Cap

Campaign Cycle Frequency

Compatibility Score Threshold

Opportunity Database Access Depth

Reporting & Analytics Access Level

Targeting Priority Queue Placement

Tier Mapping
Tier I – Foundation Representation

Submission Volume Cap:
Maximum 5 qualified submissions per month

Campaign Frequency:
One structured campaign cycle per month

Compatibility Threshold:
Standard alignment requirement

Opportunity Access Depth:
Core label database access

Analytics Access:
Basic campaign activity dashboard

Priority Queue:
Standard processing order

Tier II – Active Representation

Submission Volume Cap:
Maximum 12 qualified submissions per month

Campaign Frequency:
Two structured campaign cycles per month

Compatibility Threshold:
Enhanced filtering applied

Opportunity Access Depth:
Expanded label database access

Analytics Access:
Advanced metrics (open tracking, response indicators, trend visibility)

Priority Queue:
Elevated processing order

Tier III – Strategic Placement Campaign

Submission Volume Cap:
Maximum 20 qualified submissions per month

Campaign Frequency:
Weekly structured campaign cycles

Compatibility Threshold:
Advanced multi-factor scoring required

Opportunity Access Depth:
Full opportunity database + extended scanning

Analytics Access:
Comprehensive performance dashboard + campaign optimization insights

Priority Queue:
Top-tier targeting priority

Governance Rules

Across all tiers:

• Compatibility score must meet minimum threshold before submission
• Daily submission cap enforced platform-wide
• No auto-escalation without approval
• Follow-up timing controlled by system safeguards
• Outreach pauses if quality control triggers

Scalability Design

The intensity matrix allows:

• Backend automation logic
• Subscription-based feature gating
• Database rule enforcement
• Predictable infrastructure load
• Controlled growth without spam behavior

Operational Philosophy

Representation intensity increases strategic precision and cadence — not unrealistic guarantees.

All tiers operate within ethical outreach boundaries.
