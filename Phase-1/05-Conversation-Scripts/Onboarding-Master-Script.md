Verified Sound Representative:

Welcome to Verified Sound.
You are entering our structured representation onboarding process.

This process allows us to evaluate your positioning, prepare your professional profile, and determine strategic label compatibility.

Please provide this information.

Section 2 – Musical Positioning

Now let’s define your sound profile.

How would you describe your sound in 2–3 sentences?

Name three artists your sound aligns with.

Are you currently releasing music independently?

Have you previously released under a record label?

Are you currently under any exclusive agreement?

(If yes to exclusivity → pause and flag for review.)

Section 3 – Catalog & Release Assessment

To evaluate campaign readiness:

How many tracks have you released?

Provide links to streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple, Beatport, etc.)

Do you have upcoming releases within 90 days?

Do you have professionally mixed and mastered material ready for submission?

Section 4 – Branding & Market Direction

To build your strategic positioning:

What distinguishes your project from others in your genre?

Who is your ideal listener?

Which geographic markets are you targeting?

What is your 2-year career objective?

Section 5 – Rights Confirmation

Before we proceed:

Please confirm the following statement:

“I confirm that I own or legally control all rights to the music I submit and that no contractual agreement prevents demo submission.”

(Type CONFIRM to proceed.)

(Must block progression without confirmation.)

Section 6 – Targeting Preferences

Are there specific labels you want considered?
