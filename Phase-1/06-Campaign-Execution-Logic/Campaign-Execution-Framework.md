Campaign Execution Framework
Verified Sound – Representation Platform

Phase-1 – Operational Campaign Design

Objective

Define the structured system that governs how demo submissions are:

• Sequenced
• Scheduled
• Tracked
• Followed up
• Paused
• Optimized

This ensures disciplined outreach and protects infrastructure integrity.

1. Campaign Activation

Campaign begins only after:

• Onboarding completed
• Rights confirmation accepted
• EPK generated
• Compatibility score meets threshold
• Subscription active
• Artist approval granted

No automatic outreach without explicit activation confirmation.

2. Submission Sequencing Model

Submissions are not sent simultaneously.

They are staggered using structured cadence:

Tier I:
1 batch per month

Tier II:
2 batches per month

Tier III:
Weekly batches

Each batch:
• Contains limited qualified targets
• Is spaced 3–5 days apart
• Avoids same-day mass dispatch

3. Submission Format Governance

Each outreach must include:

• Personalized subject line
• Short pitch paragraph
• EPK link
• Streaming link
• Clear contact information
• No unsolicited attachments if prohibited

Email must appear professional, not automated.

4. Follow-Up Timing Logic

Follow-up occurs only if:

• Label policy permits
• No response within 14–21 days
• No opt-out request received

Only one follow-up per submission cycle.

No repeated chasing.

5. Tracking & Logging

For each submission, the system logs:

• Date sent
• Label name
• Submission channel
• Delivery status
• Open indicator (if available)
• Response status
• Follow-up date

This feeds dashboard analytics.

6. Campaign Pause Conditions

Outreach pauses if:

• Payment fails
• Compatibility drops below threshold
• Rights dispute arises
• Excessive rejection pattern detected
• Email reputation risk increases

Pause protects long-term platform integrity.

7. Performance Optimization Logic

If response rate is low:

System may recommend:

• Adjusted label tier
• Genre narrowing
• Bio refinement
• Tier upgrade
• Catalog improvement before next cycle

Campaigns must adapt.

8. Escalation Model (High-Score Artists)

If:

Compatibility > 85
AND
Strong release history

System may:

• Increase priority queue
• Expand geographic targeting
• Suggest advanced tier

Escalation is merit-based.

9. Campaign Integrity Principle

Outreach must always prioritize:

Precision over volume
Strategy over noise
Reputation over speed

The objective is sustainable industry credibility.
