Compatibility Scoring Framework
Verified Sound – Representation Platform

Phase-1 – Targeting Intelligence Design

Objective

Design a structured compatibility scoring system that determines strategic alignment between:

Artist Profile
and
Label Opportunity

This prevents indiscriminate submissions and preserves industry credibility.

Core Scoring Categories

Each artist-label match is evaluated across five weighted dimensions.

1. Genre Alignment (Weight: 30%)

Scoring Factors:

• Primary genre match
• Sub-genre overlap
• Release style similarity
• BPM / sonic alignment (future expansion)

Score Range: 0–30

Minimum threshold required for outreach eligibility.

2. Catalog Compatibility (Weight: 20%)

Scoring Factors:

• Production quality indicators
• Release maturity
• Catalog depth
• Similarity to label roster

Score Range: 0–20

3. Market Positioning Alignment (Weight: 20%)

Scoring Factors:

• Target audience overlap
• Geographic alignment
• Release cadence compatibility
• Brand positioning match

Score Range: 0–20

4. Professional Readiness (Weight: 15%)

Scoring Factors:

• Finished masters ready
• Streaming presence
• Release history
• Professional branding

Score Range: 0–15

5. Compliance & Risk Check (Weight: 15%)

Scoring Factors:

• No contractual conflicts
• Rights confirmation completed
• No red flags detected
• Genre within launch scope

Score Range: 0–15

Total Possible Score: 100
Outreach Eligibility Thresholds

Tier I:
Minimum 65 score required

Tier II:
Minimum 70 score required

Tier III:
Minimum 75 score required

If score falls below threshold:

• Submission does not proceed
• Artist receives strategic feedback
• System recommends improvement steps

Anti-Spam Protection Rule

Even if subscription tier allows 20 submissions:

If compatibility score < threshold:
Outreach is paused.

Quality overrides tier entitlement.

Label Health Check

Labels must also meet internal criteria:

• Active release schedule
• Public demo acceptance
• Verified contact channel
• No blacklist flags

If label health score drops:
Label removed from targeting pool.

Escalation Logic

If:

Compatibility score > 85
AND
Artist shows strong release readiness

System may:

• Prioritize higher-tier labels
• Expand geographic targeting
• Recommend Tier upgrade

Governance Philosophy

Compatibility scoring exists to:

• Protect brand reputation
• Protect email infrastructure
• Improve response probability
• Maintain strategic discipline

This is not mass marketing.

This is structured representation.
